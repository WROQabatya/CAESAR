Title: Microcontroller-Based Vehicle Control System: A C++ and Ultrasonic Sensor Approach

Introduction:
Our vehicle, named CAESAR , is an innovative microcontroller-based system that utilizes Arduino as the central controller. The Arduino microcontroller is programmed using C++ language to control various components, including motors, steering wheels, and sensors like Ultrasonic sensors. We have opted not to incorporate a Raspberry Pi or gyro sensor in our project.

C++ Code Structure:
The C++ code is thoughtfully organized into sections, each dedicated to specific functionalities.

Servo Motor and Ultrasonic Sensor Control:
We employ libraries to control the servo motor movement and interface with Ultrasonic sensors. These sensors play a crucial role in detecting obstacles and determining the vehicle's movement directions.

Global Variables:
Descriptive global variables, such as "normalSpeed" and "turnSpeed," are defined to manage the vehicle's speed and turning behavior, respectively.

Ultrasonic Sensor Functions:
Key functions, including "turnLeft()" and "turnRight()", leverage readings from Ultrasonic sensors to determine the appropriate direction for the vehicle. The Ultrasonic sensor values guide counter-clockwise and clockwise turns. Additionally, functions like "getDistance()", "getForward()", "getBack()", "getRight()", and "getLeft()" are implemented to read data from individual Ultrasonic sensors.

Setup and Main Logic:
The "setup()" function handles necessary configurations for the system, while the main logic is implemented inside the "loop()" function. The loop function continuously executes, enabling the vehicle to react to real-time changes detected by the Ultrasonic sensors.

No Gyro Sensor Integration:
In contrast to some designs, we have opted not to use a gyro sensor in our project. Instead, we focus solely on utilizing Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection and navigation.

Conclusion:
Our microcontroller-based vehicle control system showcases the capabilities of Arduino and C++ programming in managing various vehicle components. With Ultrasonic sensors serving as the primary input, our CAESAR vehicle demonstrates reliable obstacle avoidance and navigation capabilities.
